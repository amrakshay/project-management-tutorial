### **Project Lifecycle Overview**
Every project follows a lifecycle, which is a structured process to guide the project from start to finish. The lifecycle ensures the project stays on track and achieves its goals. The four main phases are:

1. **Initiate the Project**:
   - Define project goals, deliverables, budget, resources, and stakeholders.
   - Document all details in a project proposal and get approval to move forward.
   - **Example**: For a political campaign, deliverables might include raising $5,000 or collecting 500 signatures.

2. **Make a Plan**:
   - Create a detailed plan with a budget, schedule, task breakdown, team roles, and risk management strategies.
   - Planning is critical to avoid risks like delays, budget overruns, or resource shortages.
   - **Example**: Building a house requires a clear blueprint, budget, and timeline before starting construction.

3. **Execute and Complete Tasks**:
   - The team completes tasks while the project manager monitors progress, removes obstacles, and ensures deadlines are met.
   - Communication is key—use meetings, emails, and task reports to keep everyone aligned.
   - **Example**: In a house-painting project, the project manager ensures supplies are available and tasks are completed in the right order.

4. **Close the Project**:
   - Ensure all tasks are completed, resources are accounted for, and stakeholders approve the final deliverables.
   - Conduct a retrospective to reflect on what worked and what didn’t for future improvement.
   - Celebrate the team’s success to boost morale.
   - **Example**: After launching a new website, hand it over to the maintenance team and document lessons learned.

### **Project Management Methodologies**
Different projects require different approaches. Two main methodologies are **linear** and **iterative**:

1. **Linear (Waterfall)**:
   - Tasks are completed in a strict sequence, with each phase depending on the completion of the previous one.
   - Best for projects with clear, unchanging goals and minimal risk of changes.
   - **Example**: Building a house—you need the blueprint before laying the foundation, and the foundation before building walls.

2. **Iterative (Agile)**:
   - Tasks overlap, and the project evolves through feedback and adjustments.
   - Best for projects with high uncertainty or where the end goal may change.
   - **Example**: Developing a TV show—film a pilot, gather feedback, and adjust the script or cast while continuing production.

### **Popular Project Management Methods**
1. **Waterfall**:
   - Sequential, with clearly defined phases (initiate, plan, execute, close).
   - Ideal for projects with fixed requirements and budgets.
   - **Example**: Catering an event—confirm the menu, order ingredients, and prepare food in a strict sequence.

2. **Agile**:
   - Flexible and iterative, with tasks completed in short sprints (1-4 weeks).
   - Focuses on collaboration, feedback, and delivering value quickly.
   - **Example**: Building a website—launch the homepage first, then add features like a blog or appointment system based on user feedback.

3. **Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC)**:
   - A hybrid method focused on process improvement, reducing waste, and increasing efficiency.
   - Phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.
   - **Example**: Reducing customer service wait times at a travel company by analyzing data, identifying bottlenecks, and improving staffing.

### **Choosing the Right Methodology**
- **Waterfall**: Use when the project has clear, unchanging goals and a fixed budget.
- **Agile**: Use when the project requires flexibility, frequent feedback, and iterative development.
- **Lean Six Sigma**: Use for process improvement projects with a focus on efficiency and quality.

At Google, a hybrid approach is often used, combining elements of different methodologies to suit the project’s needs.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Project Lifecycle**: Follow the four phases (initiate, plan, execute, close) to ensure project success.
2. **Methodologies**:
   - **Waterfall**: Linear and sequential, best for predictable projects.
   - **Agile**: Flexible and iterative, best for evolving projects.
   - **Lean Six Sigma**: Focused on process improvement and efficiency.
3. **Adaptability**: Choose or combine methodologies based on the project’s goals, risks, and requirements.
